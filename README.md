# Readme Generator

This challenge is for module 9 of UMO coding bootcamp.

## Objective

The purpose of this challenge is to utilize the skills we learned on how to download packages, use them, and run everything in node. When the index.js file is ran the user will be prompted with a series of questions, once they are all answered, they are entered into a readme that is already formatted using a function, then created into a new README.md file.
